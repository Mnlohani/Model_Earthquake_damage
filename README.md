# Competition: [Richter's Predictor: Modeling Earthquake Damage](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/57/nepal-earthquake/)

## Project Description

Based on aspects of building location and construction, the goal is to predict the level of damage to buildings caused by the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal. The objective is to predict the ordinal variable damage_grade, which represents a level of damage to the building that was hit by the earthquake. There are 3 grades of the damage:

- 1 represents low damage
- 2 represents a medium amount of damage
- 3 represents almost complete destruction

## Dataset

The [Dataset](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/57/nepal-earthquake/data/) mainly consists of information on the buildings' structure and their legal ownership.There are 39 columns in this dataset with the building_id as unique identifier.
